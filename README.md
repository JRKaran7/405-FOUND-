“Until you get your nutrition right, nothing will change.” – Anonymous (https://deliberatedirections.com/quotes-about-nutrition/) <br>
A wonderful quote that people today try to follow. Along with heavy workouts, nutrition and a perfect diet are what keep a body healthy. Considering the developing world, people are following fitness influences on popular social media sites like Instagram and TikTok, but they don't realise the cons of this. Without any research or evidence, people have begun believing each and every fact of influencers. There are new trends introduced, such as the 70-day challenge, skip carbs, take protein, etc. But what does science say about it? Well, there is no definitive answer because there is no influencer who has the right evidence. Therefore, our team's aim is to develop a chatbot that can provide straightforward, factual, and helpful responses to queries on nutrition, thus debunking myths and false claims to provide the right answer.<br>
